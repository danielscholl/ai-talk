# FALLBACK PROMPT CHAIN EXAMPLE (Bash)
#
# This script demonstrates the pattern of:
#  1) Trying a primary model/approach first
#  2) Validating the response against specific criteria
#  3) Falling back to alternative models if validation fails
#
# This pattern enables graceful degradation and increased reliability
# by providing multiple paths to success with different models.

# The prompt to send to each model in the fallback chain

INPUT_PROMPT="Solve the following simple scheduling problem:

A tech company needs to schedule 4 employees (Alice, Bob, Carlos, and Diana) for a project across Monday through Friday. Each day requires exactly 2 employees to be working.

Given these constraints:
1. The schedule for Monday MUST be Carlos and Diana.
2. The schedule for Tuesday MUST be Alice and Carlos.
3. The schedule for Wednesday MUST be Bob and Diana.
4. The schedule for Thursday MUST be Alice and Diana.
5. The schedule for Friday MUST be Alice and Bob.

Provide ONLY a JSON response with the solution, following this exact format with no additional text:
{
  \"solution\": {
    \"Monday\": [\"Carlos\", \"Diana\"],
    \"Tuesday\": [\"Alice\", \"Carlos\"],
    \"Wednesday\": [\"Bob\", \"Diana\"],
    \"Thursday\": [\"Alice\", \"Diana\"],
    \"Friday\": [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"]
  }
}

Make sure your solution exactly matches the required schedule."
